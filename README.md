# Scientific-computing

This repo contains exercises for three lectures and one lab course relevant to scientific computing.

The lab course gives an application oriented introduction to the following topics:

* discrete systems based on simple state transitions (Markov chains)
* explicit and implicit time stepping methods for ordinary differential equations
* numerical methods for stationary and instationary partial differential equations
* solvers for large, sparse systems of linear equations
* adaptivity and adaptively refined discretization grids
* applications from fluid dynamics and heat transfer.
